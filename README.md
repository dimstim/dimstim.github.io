Liquid-ized Slate
=================

[I've](https://mspacek.github.io) taken Jason Colstello's
[Slate](https://github.com/jsncostello/slate/) theme and turned it into a template for a
Jekyll site by simply replacing the example content in the `index.html` with `{{ Liquid
template tags }}`. This lets you write your content in Markdown, like with the provided
`index.md`. I've also added a `_config.yml` file.

Some of this was inspired by [Barry Clark's](https://github.com/barryclark) project [Jekyll
Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) and his article at [Smashing
Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/).
